Summary

The dataset I worked is the baseball data set. It consists
of 1,157 baseball players. The baseball player's handedness,
height (in inches), batting average, home runs, and weight(in pounds)
were all aspects of each player.

Design

Immediately after I received the data, I knew I wanted to categorize the
data based on a specific factor. I noticed that handedness was the only variable
that could be categorized without cleaning the data. Initially, I decided to graph
handedness of the data versus the batting average of the players in a lineplot. After
receiving feedback, I determined that this did not provide a clear visual. I then switched
to the 'HR' attribute of the data, standing for homeruns. I noticed that the correlation between
homeruns and handedness was more noticeable visually. Again, after recieving feedback I decided to
change the graph type from a scatter plot to a bargraph which would
depict the handedness of the batters and their average homerun output appropritely.


Feedback

1.  The graph of handedness and average didn't really show me anything.
2.  The graph of hr and handedness was better but still as a scatterplot
    required a person to look at it for a while to see the trend.
3.The graph of hr and handedness  with average equailing x2 confuses the viewer of the graph
"keep it simple"
4. Bargraph of handedness and hr shows a specific trend that
can be noticed right away.
